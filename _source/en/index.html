        Friendly Errors i18n Book project is a part of the internationalization effort on the p5.js, Friendly Errors System (FES). We welcome anyone who wants to contribute a translation or improve the experience of FES. We also want to invite people interested in accessibility and software internationalization issues in general.</p>
      <p>
        We are FES Korean translation team, who gathered in 2021-2022 to co-translate the p5js library's Friendly Error messages into Korean. What started as a co-translation project quickly led to discussions about software internationalization issues and challenges. We wanted to talk about the experience of the software internationalization process as someone from a destination culture (as opposed to an English-speaking culture where the technology originated).</p>
      <p>
        The following six "guides" and an interview do not try to propose a unified standard for the internationalization process. Instead, each would be an example of how one from a non-English culture would approach the internationalization of accessible design and community-based software ‚Äî From people who would welcome, learn, follow, extend, fear, adopt, doubt, hack, reframe, critique, and cherish open-source software. Our effort came nowhere close to fully representing the whole, diverse experience of non-English culture. Still, we wished to capture our own experience and create a starting ground.</p>

        What is the problem with simplifying the recipient of Friendly Errors to "beginners"? We need to cultivate a caring attitude that will reduce the possible chance of alienating, objectifying, or otherizing people who would benefit from the Friendly Errors system.
